What is Covoyage?
---

Covoyage is an enterprise-level CI/CD solution.

We believe that an enterprise-level CI/CD solution should have the following features:

- Supports mainstream version control tools like Git and SVN, capable of automatically detecting code changes and triggering builds.

- Supports building in multiple programming languages, automating code compilation, packaging, and generating deployable artifacts.

- Integrates various types of automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, and provides detailed test reports.

- Automates the entire process from build to release, including but not limited to containerized application deployment and host service deployment.

- Integrates security scanning, such as vulnerability scanning and compliance checks, to ensure application security.

- Supports custom plugins and extensions, allowing users to write custom scripts to meet specific needs.

- Has a comprehensive account system, supporting fine-grained user permission settings to ensure only authorized personnel can access specific resources or perform related operations.

- Supports custom pipeline templates.

- Supports integration with enterprise account systems using standard SSO protocols (SAML, OIDC, LDAP, etc.).

- Provides efficiency insights, generating reports on metrics like build success rate and deployment frequency to accurately analyze development efficiency shortcomings.

- Supports multi-scenario deployment, not limited to local servers, but also supporting public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud environments.

- Pipelines support both visual and configuration file editing, making it easy to define and modify CI/CD pipelines.

- Offers a comprehensive OpenAPI for easy integration with third-party systems.

- Has a quick rollback feature, allowing rapid rollback to the last stable version in case of deployment failure.

- Provides complete pipeline execution records, making it easy to view and troubleshoot issues based on historical execution logs.

- Supports canary deployment strategies to reduce release risks.

- Records comprehensive operation logs for auditing and troubleshooting.

- Supports cluster or distributed deployment to avoid single points of failure.

- Capable of handling high-concurrency build and deployment tasks.
